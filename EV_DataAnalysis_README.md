# ⚡ EV Data Analysis Dashboard

> **Tagline:** Interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption, market trends, and manufacturer performance across the United States.

**GitHub About Section (suggestion):**  
Visual exploration of electric vehicle registration data — uncovering trends in EV adoption, manufacturer dominance, model growth, and CAFV eligibility using Tableau and Excel.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project presents an **Electric Vehicle (EV) Data Analysis Dashboard** built using **Tableau** and **Excel**.  
It analyzes trends in EV registrations, battery electric vehicle (BEV) vs plug-in hybrid (PHEV) distribution, average electric range, top-performing models and manufacturers, and Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility across U.S. states.

The dashboard provides policymakers, manufacturers, and analysts with insights into **EV adoption trends**, **regional concentration**, and **market share**.

## 📊 Key Insights from the Dashboard

### 🧭 Overview KPIs

| Metric | Value | Insight |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Total Vehicles** | **150,413** | Represents all registered electric vehicles analyzed. |
| **Avg. Electric Range** | **67.83 miles** | Indicates modest average range across the dataset, driven by older models and PHEVs. |
| **BEV Vehicles** | **116,745 (77.6%)** | Majority of vehicles are fully electric, reflecting strong BEV adoption. |
| **PHEV Vehicles** | **33,668 (22.4%)** | Hybrid vehicles still hold relevance for transitional consumers. |

---

### 📈 EV Growth by Model Year
- Growth has **accelerated exponentially** since 2015, peaking at **37,080 vehicles in 2022**.  
- Registrations surged after policy incentives and improved charging infrastructure.  
- Slight decline in 2023 may be due to incomplete data collection or ongoing market normalization.

🧠 *Insight:* EV adoption is scaling quickly, signaling mainstream consumer transition toward electric mobility.
